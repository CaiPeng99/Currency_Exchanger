# Online Currency_Converter
**Spring Boot-based Microservices**

## Project Intro

Currency_Converter is a Spring Boot-based microservices app, offering a robust, scalable distributed system with high-performance concurrency and comprehensive CI/CD integration. Each microservice operates with its own dedicated database, ensuring data isolation and consistency. **Eureka** is employed for dynamic service discovery, while **RabbitMQ** ensures reliable and asynchronous messaging between services.

External requests are managed by **Spring Cloud Gateway**, providing intelligent routing and load balancing. **Zipkin** is integrated for distributed tracing, offering deep insights into the system's performance and latency. **Spring Cloud Config** centralizes the management of configuration properties across the microservices, enhancing consistency and flexibility. And load balancing with **Spring Cloud LoadBalancer**.

To ensure resilience, **Resilience4J** introduces fault tolerance patterns, such as circuit breakers and rate limiters, safeguarding against cascading failures. **Spring Security** is implemented to provide robust authentication and authorization mechanisms, protecting sensitive exchange operations.

The application is containerized using **Docker** and deployed on **Kubernetes** for scalable orchestration and management.Prometheus and Grafana are integrated for monitoring, allowing for real-time tracking of system health and performance metrics.

## TakeAways
### 1. Why using Microservice architecture?
#### Scalability
Independent Scaling: Each service can be scaled independently based on its specific needs, improving resource utilization.<br>
e.g.: We can scale up/down based on our needs.<br>
#### Flexibility in Technology Stack
Technology Diversity: Different microservices can be developed using different programming languages, databases, or frameworks, allowing teams to choose the best tool for each job.<br>
e.g.: We can have one microservice wrote in Python, one in Java, other one in C++.<br>
#### Resilience and Fault Isolation
Isolation: If one service fails, it doesnâ€™t necessarily bring down the entire application, as microservices are isolated.<br>
e.g.: We can debug the one we want.<be>
